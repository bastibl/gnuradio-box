## Credentials

``` bash
user: gnuradio
password: gnuradio
```

### SSH Login

``` bash
ssh -p2222 gnuradio@localhost
```

Password is `gnuradio`.

You might want to add something like this to your SSH config (`~/.ssh/config`):

``` bash
Host vm
	Hostname localhost
	User gnuradio
	Port 2222
	UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
	StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

With this config, you can login with `ssh vm` and your password.


## Customization

If you want to rebuild and customize the environment, read on...

```bash
sudo apt install packer
sudo apt install virtualbox virtualbox-ext-pack
```

On Ubuntu, your user should be in the `vboxusers` group.

``` bash
sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers <your username>
```

You have to logout and login again for the changes to take effect.

GitHub doesn't allow uploading files over 100Mb and, therefore, prevents adding the OpenCL runtime to the repo.
Please download the runtime and put it into the `assets` folder.

## Create Image

You have to be online to build the image.
Then, just run:

``` bash
packer build base.json
packer build gnuradio.json
```

## Live Image

TBD. See the `gen_iso.sh` and `chroot.sh` script.
